# 📚 DSA Practice (Python)

This repository contains my classroom practice of basic Data Structures implemented in Python.

These programs were written during class with guidance from my instructor.  
This is not treated as a challenge project — it is practice to build foundational understanding.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Singly Linked List

**Concepts Practiced:**
- Node creation
- Head pointer management
- Insertion at beginning
- Traversal using loop
- Basic reference linking

**Key Learning:**
- How nodes connect using `next`
- How linked lists differ from arrays
- How traversal works internally


---

### 2️⃣ Stack (Using collections.deque)

**Operations Implemented:**
- `push()`
- `pop()`
- `peek()`

**Concepts Practiced:**
- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Stack underflow handling
- Class-based structure implementation


---

### 3️⃣ Queue (Using collections.deque)

**Operations Implemented:**
- `enqueue()`
- `dequeue()`
- `peek()`

**Concepts Practiced:**
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- Order management
- Empty queue handling
